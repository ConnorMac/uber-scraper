# uber-scraper

This is very rudementary way to do a quick calcution on your total spend on uber and the totals for each month.
It does not take into account discounts or shared rides.

1. Login to https://riders.uber.com/trips
2. Run the sections in order as specified in the manual.js file
3. run ``` node calculateThings.js ```

## TODO: Make a simple interface to auto-login and scrape all in one.
